If someone likes Mint-Y-Dark theme, but at the same time thinks that new "cinnamon" theme with rounded corners, new notifications and dialogs is nice, then maybe this one is for you.
Changes includes:
- green accents
- green application counter badge
- green toggle button
- some changes in dialog and panels to get rid of light grey lines.

All you have to do is download the package and follow the instructions from commands.txt or execute green_cinnamon.sh script with root privileges.

<b>NOTE: Currently it is mostly a tweak of colours in existing cinnamon.css file. Therefore, each Mint update can override it back to default and instructions from commands.txt or green_cinnamon.sh script will have to be executed again.</b>
